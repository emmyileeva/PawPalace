                    <p class="card-text">Bringing home a new puppy is an exciting and rewarding experience, but it also comes with its challenges. Here are some
                    essential tips to help you get started on the right paw with your furry friend:</p>
                    <div id="article1-full" style="display: none;">
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                            <li><strong>1. Puppy-proof Your Home</strong><br>
                            Before your puppy arrives, make sure to puppy-proof your home. Remove any hazardous items or objects that your
                            puppy could chew on, such as electrical cords, small toys, and household chemicals. Consider using baby gates to
                            block off areas of your home that are off-limits to your puppy.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>2. Create a Safe Space</strong><br>
                                Set up a cozy and secure area for your puppy to relax and sleep. This could be a crate or a designated corner of
                                a room with a comfortable bed. Make sure the space is warm, quiet, and free from any potential dangers.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>3. Establish a Routine</strong><br>
                                Dogs thrive on routine, so establish a consistent schedule for feeding, potty breaks, playtime, and training
                                sessions. This will help your puppy feel secure and confident in their new environment.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>4. Socialization is Key</strong><br>
                                Expose your puppy to different people, animals, and environments from a young age to help them develop into
                                well-adjusted and confident adults. Arrange playdates with other friendly dogs, take them to puppy socialization
                                classes, and introduce them to new sights, sounds, and smells.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>5. Start Training Early</strong><br>
                                Begin training your puppy as soon as you bring them home. Teach them basic commands like sit, stay, and come,
                                using positive reinforcement techniques such as treats and praise. Consistency and patience are key when it
                                comes to training a puppy.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>6. Provide Plenty of Exercise</strong><br>
                                Puppies have lots of energy to burn, so make sure to provide them with plenty of opportunities for exercise and
                                play. Take them for daily walks, engage in interactive play sessions, and provide them with toys and puzzles to
                                keep them mentally stimulated.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>7. Be Patient and Understanding</strong><br>
                                Remember that puppies are still learning and exploring the world around them. Be patient and understanding as
                                they adjust to their new home and surroundings. Show them lots of love, affection, and encouragement, and
                                they'll soon become your loyal and loving companion.

                    <h2 class="card-title">Training Your Puppy</h2>
                    <p class="card-text">Training your puppy is an essential part of building a strong bond and fostering good behavior. Start early and be
                    consistent with your training efforts to set your puppy up for success. Here are some key tips to help you get started:</p>
                    <div id="article2-full" style="display: none;">
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li><strong>1. Positive Reinforcement</strong><br> Use rewards like treats, praise, and toys to encourage good behavior.
                            Positive reinforcement helps your puppy associate obedience with positive outcomes.</li>
                            <li><strong>2. Basic Commands</strong><br> Teach your puppy basic commands such as sit, stay, come, and down. These commands
                                are the foundation for more advanced training and help establish boundaries.</li>

                            <li><strong>3. Patience</strong><br> Training takes time and patience. Be patient with your puppy as they learn and avoid
                                punishment-based methods, which can lead to fear and aggression.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>4. Consistency</strong><br> Use consistent cues and commands to avoid confusion. Everyone in the household should
                                use the same language and techniques to reinforce training.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>5. Short Sessions</strong><br> Keep training sessions short and frequent to prevent boredom and maintain focus.
                                Aim for multiple sessions throughout the day, each lasting no more than 10-15 minutes.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>6. Socialization</strong><br> Expose your puppy to different environments, people, and animals to build confidence
                                and prevent fear-based behaviors. Gradually introduce new experiences in a positive and controlled manner.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>7. Professional Help</strong><br> Don't hesitate to seek guidance from a professional trainer or behaviorist if
                                you encounter challenges or need additional support with training.</li>

                    wellness tips to ensure your puppy grows into a strong and vibrant companion:</p>
                    <div id="article3-full" style="display: none;">
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                            <li><strong>1. Regular Vet Checkups</strong><br>
                                Schedule regular checkups with your veterinarian to monitor your puppy's health and address any concerns early on.
                                Vaccinations, deworming, and preventive care are crucial for preventing illnesses and maintaining optimal health.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>2. Nutritious Diet</strong><br>
                                Provide your puppy with a balanced and nutritious diet tailored to their age, breed, and size. High-quality puppy food
                                that is rich in essential nutrients like protein, vitamins, and minerals will support their growth and development.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>3. Proper Hydration</strong><br>
                                Make sure your puppy has access to fresh, clean water at all times. Proper hydration is essential for maintaining
                                healthy organ function and preventing dehydration, especially during hot weather or after physical activity.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>4. Regular Exercise</strong><br>
                                Engage your puppy in regular exercise to promote physical fitness and mental stimulation. Daily walks, play sessions,
                                and interactive toys will help burn off excess energy, prevent obesity, and strengthen their muscles and joints.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>5. Dental Care</strong><br>
                                Establish a dental care routine early on to keep your puppy's teeth and gums healthy. Brush their teeth regularly with a
                                pet-safe toothbrush and toothpaste, offer dental chews or toys for chewing, and schedule professional cleanings as
                                recommended by your vet.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>6. Parasite Prevention</strong><br>
                                Protect your puppy from parasites like fleas, ticks, and worms by following a regular preventive care regimen. Use flea
                                and tick preventives, administer deworming medications as directed, and keep their living environment clean and free
                                from pests.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>7. Grooming</strong><br>
                                Regular grooming is essential for your puppy's health and hygiene. Brush their coat regularly to remove loose fur and
                                prevent matting, trim their nails to a safe length, and clean their ears and eyes to prevent infections.
                            </li>
